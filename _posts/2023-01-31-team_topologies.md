#### tl;dr
An excellent examination of how organizational structure and culture can enable and/or inhibit software delivery.  The topics are enhanced with multiple case studies that illustrate the authors' points and are interesting to read.

#### Review
*Team Topologies* came highly recommended by several of my colleagues in consulting.  It is easy to see why they loved this book.  Matthew Skelton and Manuel Pais, the authors, are consultants, and this book lays out an approach to tackle the major organizational obstacles they have encountered at clients.
 
I particularly enjoyed their focus on monolithic *organizational* obstaclies, having encountered most of the monolithic obstacles the authors outline at various times.

Skelton and Pais outline an organizational approach that focuses on team patterns and interactions (Topologies) to create a healthy, effective development culture.  Their approach makes sense, and I would like to read about organizations that have implemented their ideas.

*Team Topologies* lays out an interesting approach to common problems and is worth reading.  Unfortunately I think that implementing this approach will meet serious resistance in many organizations.
