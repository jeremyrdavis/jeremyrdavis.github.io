I am excited to be writing a book for Packt!  The provisional title is, "Java Applications Migration to Microservices," and this is a subject that I have spent a lot of time with.  The contract is signed so I am officially on the hook for a March publication date.

The tldr is: start greenfield applications as monoliths that are easy to refactor into microservices.  There will be a sample application, and I hope lots of useful techniques for building apps.
