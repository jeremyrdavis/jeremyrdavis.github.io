I have live and virtual sessions for <a href="https://www.developerweek.com/cloudx/" target="_blank" >DeveloperWeek CloudX</a>. The live session will be in San Mateo on Tuesday, August 13th, and the virtual session on Tuesday, August 22nd.

My presentation is, "Live Coding Kubernetes Native Java (with Developer Joy)."  It is all code and no slides.  Quarkus dev mode is great for this kind of presentation!
