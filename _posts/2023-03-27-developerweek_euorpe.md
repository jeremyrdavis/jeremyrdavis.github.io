I delivered a presentation and participated in a fireside chat at at <a href="https://www.developerweek.com/europe/" target="_blank" >DeveloperWeek Europe</a> on June 13th.  My presentation was, "A Live Coding Introduction to Domain Driven Design and Hexagonal Architecture."  The source code is on <a href="https://github.com/jeremyrdavis/developerweek-2023-26-april" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.

This presentation is all live coding of a application for registering conference attendees.  Hopefully the source code is easy to follow.  Feel free to contact me if you have any questions!

The fireside chat was fun.  The other panelists were <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/maxkoerbaecher/" target="_blank">Max K&#246;rb&#228;cher and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/christineyen/" target="_blank">Christine Yen</a>.  We had similiar thoughts about the future of our profession, and hopefully we are all correct because we all think development will grow and environments will become easier to use!
