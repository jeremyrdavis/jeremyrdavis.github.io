I will be presenting at <a href="https://devnexus.com" target="_blank" >Devnexus</a> again this year.  My presentation is, "Walking to School in the Snow or What To Do When You Aren't Building Bridges With Bricks."

I will talk about:
- Putting Architects in the Elevators
- Composable Organizations
- Product vs. Project Thinking
- Paved Paths and Golden Roads
- Data Meshes

It is an honor to present at Devnexus.  <a href="https://ajug.org" target="_blank">AJUG</a> has been a huge influence and source of information throughout my career, and I have attended all but one Devenexuses.
