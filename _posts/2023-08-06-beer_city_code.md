I presented at <a href="https://www.beercitycode.com" target="_blank" >Beer City Code</a> on August 5th.  I had 2 talks: "7 Strategies for Building Majestic Monoliths" and "A Live Coding Introduction to Domain Driven Design and Hexagonal Architecture."

This was a fun conference, and I got the chance to hang out with both attendees and other presenters.  I ran into fellow Atlantans in the airport, and having spotted their DevNexus backpack deduced that they were presenting.
