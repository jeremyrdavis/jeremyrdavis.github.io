#### tl;dr
Sprint documents the approach Google Ventures uses to quickly try out new ideas.  It is interesting and engaging, and <em>might</em> be useful in other formats

#### Review
*Sprint: How to Solve Big Problems and Test New Ideas in Just Five Days* address documents the approach Google Ventures uses to quickly try out new ideas.  The Spring, which should not be confused with the Agile term, takes 5 days during which teams build and validate a prototype.

It is hard to argue with Google Ventures' success, and I would like to implement their technique.  I imaging that getting executive buy in to try the approach would prove difficult.

My favorite takeaway is their use of *nearly* functional prototypes.  I could have saved much time in my career by building less functional prototypes.
