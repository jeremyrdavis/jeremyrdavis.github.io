I presented at <a href="https://www.agileandbeyond.com" target="_blank" >Agile and Beyond</a> on June 13th.  My presentation was, "Walking to School in the Snow or What To Do When You Aren't Building Bridges With Bricks."

I didn't do any coding in this presentation, and I didn't have any words on the slides.  I covered some great topics, that I could only touch on them in 45 minutes.  I look forward to putting together individual material for them.

Just before delivering my own talk I attended a great presentation, "A Feminist Outlook on Digital Transformation."   The talk was full of interesting ideas, and I got a couple of book suggestions from the presenter, Cat Swetel.  Unfortunately it made me a bit nervous because I was up immediately after and while I had good material I was not going to address any big picture societal issues!
