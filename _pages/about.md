### Me

I'm a Chief Architect/Solutions Architect at <a href="https://www.redhat.com/" target="_blank_" >Red Hat, Inc.</a>  I work with Red Hat's customers to design and build solutions with Red Hat software.  In my case the solutions mostly involve cloud and development things.

I started my career as a dotcom web monkey writing cross browser JavaScript and backend stuff in Perl.  Since then I have been paid to code in C, C#, Groovy, Java, JavaScript Python, and Visual Basic.  I spent a lot of time with Ruby, but I never managed to get any into production.

I also speak at conferences and co-host Red Hat's <a href="https://red.ht/3qXl1zk" target="_blank">Developer's Corner</a> series with my colleague <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/robert-sedor/" target="_blank">Rob Sedor</a>.

### Why "arrogantprogrammer/argntprgrmr"?

My social media accounts use "argntprgrmr" or "arrogantprogrammer," but I'm not an arrogant jerk!

A friend suggested I title my blog, "arrogantprogrammer," because it was arrogant of to think anyone would care what I thought.  Although I like to think that as an Ada developer (at the time anyway) he read less blogs than the (mostly) Java, JavaScript, web, cloud developer audiences of which I consider myself a part.

Many years ago I blogged at blogspot, http://arrogantprogrammer.blogspot.com. I produced a few widely read posts while blogging there and was the top Google result for a couple of searches around JBoss Application Server and Ruby headaches.
