### Me

I'm a Solutions Architect at <a href="https://www.redhat.com/" target="_blank_" >Red Hat, Inc.</a> with the current title, "Chief Architect." I work with Red Hat's customers to design and build solutions with Red Hat software.  In my case the solutions mostly involve cloud and application development.

I started my career as a dotcom web monkey writing cross browser JavaScript and Perl on the server.  Since then I have been paid to code in C, C#, Groovy, Java, JavaScript Python, and Visual Basic.  I spent a lot of time with Ruby, but I never managed to get any into production before creating this blog with Jekyll.

I also speak at conferences and co-host a DevNation stream <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/devnation" target="_blank">Developer's Corner</a> with my colleague <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/robert-sedor/" target="_blank">Rob Sedor</a>.

### Why "arrogantprogrammer/argntprgrmr"?

My social media accounts use "argntprgrmr" or "arrogantprogrammer," but I'm not an arrogant jerk!

A friend suggested I title my blog, "arrogantprogrammer," because it was arrogant to assume anyone cared what I thought about programming.  He was an Ada developer at the time.  I think Ada developers read less blogs than the (mostly) Java, JavaScript, web, cloud tribe of which I consider myself a part.

Many years ago I blogged at blogspot, http://arrogantprogrammer.blogspot.com. I produced a few widely read posts while blogging there and was the top Google result for a couple of searches around JBoss Application Server and Ruby.
