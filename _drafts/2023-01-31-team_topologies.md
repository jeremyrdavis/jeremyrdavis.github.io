#### tl;dr
An excellent examination of how organizational structure and culture can enable and/or inhibit software delivery.  The topics are enhanced with multiple case studies that illustrate the authors' points and are interesting to read.

This chpater resonated with me because I have encountered most of the monolithic obstacles the authors outline at various points of my career.
