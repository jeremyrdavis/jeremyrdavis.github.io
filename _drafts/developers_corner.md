####  Rob Sedor and are now streaming Developers' Corner on YouTube

Rob started Developers' Corner during the COVID lockdown as a way to stay in touch with customers.  The original format was behind a "register wall," and primarily promoted to existing Red Hat customers.

I joined Rob in 2021, and we've been streaming monthly for the past 2 years.
